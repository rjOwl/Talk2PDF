Develop a Python-based application that uses AI/ML techniques to create a chatbot capable
of answering user questions based on information extracted from PDF documents. The
application should enable users to upload documents and interact with the chatbot through
a simple, accessible interface.
Requirements
1. Document Upload API
• API Endpoint: Create an API endpoint allowing users to upload PDF documents.
• Text Extraction: Extract and process text from uploaded documents for use as the
chatbot’s knowledge base.
2. Chatbot API
• Conversational Endpoint: Implement an API endpoint where users can submit questions,
and the chatbot responds with answers based on the document content.
• NLP and AI Models: Use NLP techniques and relevant AI models to provide accurate,
contextually relevant responses.
3. User Interface
• Interface Design: Develop a basic, user-friendly interface that allows users to:
- Upload PDF documents.
- Interact with the chatbot directly through a chat window.
• Usability: Ensure the interface is simple, clear, and facilitates easy interaction with the
chatbot.
4. Deployment with Docker
• Containerization: Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application for easy deployment.
• Dependencies and Configuration: Ensure all dependencies and configurations are included
in the Docker container.
5. Code Management and GitHub
• Version Control: Push the completed project codebase to a GitHub repository.
• Code Quality: Write clear, well-structured, and readable code with appropriate comments
and documentation.
• Documentation: Include a `README.md` file containing:

- Setup instructions.
- API documentation.
- An overview of the chatbot’s features and functionalities.
